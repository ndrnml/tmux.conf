This repository contains my tmux.conf tested for Xubuntu 24.04 LTS bash in xfce4-terminal.

Plugins:

* https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm
* https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-prefix-highlight
* https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-sensible
* https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect
* https://github.com/thewtex/tmux-mem-cpu-load

TODOs:

- [x] The yank plugin is disabled.
- [ ] Copying works with xfce4-terminal by highlighting and reading out the 'xsel' buffer. Really?
- [ ] Fix color issues with vim (doesn't happen with nvim)
